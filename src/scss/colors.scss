// We're following this naming convention for color variables: http://davidwalsh.name/sass-color-variables-dont-suck
// Colors are named using this tool: http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color
// If 2 colors have the same names generated from the tool above,
// that means they're too similar, so just use the one that's already on our list
// Please ALPHABETIZE the colors and have them all in lowercase to prevent dupes
